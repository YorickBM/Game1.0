package Textfied;

/*

This package contains code thats has been fully coded by Yorick...
Font Rendering code has been created by @author Karl, modified
 or rewritten by @author Yorick.

By using this API you DO NOT claim that you made this API yourself.
Also Credits in the game would be appreciated :D.

Your free to modify any of this code but after modification you can still
not claim that you made this API.

Just got something left to say, DO NOT FORGET to put an background image or something 
on loading your display, while using Text fields the basic background will be RED.
If you are advanced enough to find where i put that bit of code you can change it, or
you just set the background screen color on creating the display or while updating the Display.

An display manager has also been given to you just note that that Display is for LWJGL 2.

Have fun using this API for any questions or suggestions you can leave them on
the GitHub page, i hope this will make your live a bit easy on Text fields in your game.
